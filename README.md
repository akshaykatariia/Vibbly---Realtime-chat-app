# 💬 Vibbly – MERN Realtime Chat App

A **real-time chat application** built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** and **Socket.IO**.  
Currently, the **frontend** is being developed with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS.  
The **backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Socket.IO)** will be added in the next phase.

## 🎯 Purpose

Most chat apps today are either too complex or locked behind third-party platforms.  
**Vibbly** is my attempt to build a **lightweight, modern, and developer-friendly chat application** that includes the essential features: authentication, real-time messaging, and media support.  

This project also serves as a **learning and portfolio project**, showcasing how to structure and scale a full MERN stack app with real-time communication.
